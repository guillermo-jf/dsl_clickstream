    "## Task 2: Writing Dataflow batch pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you use Apache Beam and Dataflow to run a batch processing pipeline to accomplish the same job as in the previous task. Read the data from Cloud Storage, parse it, and write it to BigQuery using a schema that is optimized for analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Apache Beam, create a pipeline to migrate the clickstream data to BigQuery in accordance with the schema you created earlier. Program the pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",

    "Once you have the pipeline tested, run it using Google Cloud Dataflow."
